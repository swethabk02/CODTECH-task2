OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this program is to allow users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, determine the corresponding letter grade based on predefined thresholds, and compute the GPA using a specified grading scale.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
1. Input Handling: Prompt users to input grades for subjects or assignments until they choose to finish.
2. Grade Calculation: Calculate the total grade points and average grade across all subjects.
3. Letter Grade Determination: Use predefined thresholds to assign a letter grade based on the average grade calculated.
4. GPA Calculation: Convert the letter grade into a GPA value using a specified GPA scale.
5. Output Display: Display the entered grades, average grade, assigned letter grade, and computed GPA to the user.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
1. Python Programming Language: Used for implementing the program logic, handling user input, and performing calculations.
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code), used for writing, debugging, and running Python scripts.
3. Terminal - Used for executing the Python script and interacting with the program.
4. Standard Libraries: Utilized for basic input/output operations (`input` function), mathematical calculations (`sum`, `len` functions), and dictionary operations (`get` method for GPA scale).
